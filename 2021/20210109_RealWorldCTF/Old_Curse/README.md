# Old Curse
This was a pretty difficult challenge, and only 5 teams were able to solve it during the CTF.<br><br>It is an RSA like system based on Elliptic Curves with a 1024 bit modulus. I haven't had the time to try and solve this after the ctf but I found out that the name of the cryptosystem is `Demytkoâ€™s EllipticCurve Cryptosystem` and the attack is present in [this paper](https://https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1050.pdf)

# RealWorld CTF 2021
This CTF has two crypto challenges: <br>
Homebrewed Curve: 25 solves, 171 points <br>
Old Curse: 6 solves, 378 points <br>
<br>
The Challenges here were very difficult but I think that was to be expected. I could only solve Hombrewed Cuve during the CTF. There were a couple of blockchain challenges too but I didn't try those.

# TetCTF 2021
This CTF has three challenges:
unimplemented: 60 solves, 100 points
uncollidable: 23 solves, 728 points
unevaluated: 3 solves, 993 points

The challenges were very good and fun to solve, during the CTF I could only get the first one but I was very close to solving the second one too.
NDH was the author of these challenges and he did a very good job, I just wish there were more haha.

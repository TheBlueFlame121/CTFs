# No login
 web exploitation, 200 points

## Description
 Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52920`

## Hints
 What is it actually looking for in the cookie?

## Solution
 This is pretty similar to the previous cookie login problem, except this time we have to create a cookie instead of editing it.

 so just create a cookie called admin with the value True and voila! it gives you the flag.

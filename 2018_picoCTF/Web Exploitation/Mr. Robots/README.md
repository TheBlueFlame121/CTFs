# Mr. Robots
 web exploitation, 200 points

## Description
  Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away? `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:15298`

## Hints
 What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
 Both the title and the hint refer to /robots.txt which is a list of searches that aren't allowed. Vising `2018shell.picoctf.com:15298/robots.txt`, we see the following:

 we can see that ./c4075.html is disallowed, so we go to `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:15298/c4075.html`, which gives us our flag

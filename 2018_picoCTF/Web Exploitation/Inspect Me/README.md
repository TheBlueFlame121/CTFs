## Description
 Inpect this code! `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:47428`

## Hints
 How do you inspect a website's code on a browser?
 Check all the website code.

## Solution
 As instructed, we inspect the website's code to find parts of flag scattered around. The first part was in the html code and the second one in css.

 ```html
 <!-- I learned HTML! Here's part 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe -->
 ```

 ```css
 /* I learned CSS! Here's part 2/3 of the flag: ct0r_g4dget_e96dd105} */
 ```

 Note: while it does say the flag has three parts, the third part (which was in the javascript) was empty

## Flag
>picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_e96dd105}

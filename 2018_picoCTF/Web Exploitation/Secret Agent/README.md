# Seret Agent
 web exploitation, 200 points

## Description
  Here's a little website that hasn't fully been finished. But I heard google gets all your info anyway. `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53383`

## Hints
 How can your browser pretend to be something else?

## Solution
 This challange is based on user-agents. This is what your browser uses to identify itself. As the site, we have to make it look like google is accessing the site, so we change our user angent to that of a google bot: `Googlebot-Image/1.0 - Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)` and it gives us the flag

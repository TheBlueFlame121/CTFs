# Logon 
 web exploitation, 150 points

## Description
  I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:62746`

## Hints
 Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins? 
 How does check the admin's password? 

## Solution
 We are greeted by the login when we load up the page. True to the words in the hint, it lets us login without any credentials, but doesn't givs us the flag

 Inspecting the cookies, we see the username and password cookies, along with a cookie called 'admin' which is set to False

 Setting the cookie value to True and reloading the page makes it think we are admin and gives us the flag!

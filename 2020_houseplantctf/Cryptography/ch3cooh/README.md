## Hints
 Short keys are never a good thing in cryptography.

## Solution
 This was a simple vigenere cipher which I broke using this [tool](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver).

 The recovered plaintext was as follows:

>Vinegar is an aqueous solution of acetic acid and trace chemicals that may include flavorings.
>Vinegar typically contains five to eight percent acetic acid by volume.
>Usually the acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol or sugars by acetic acid bacteria.
>There are many types of vinegar, depending on source materials.
>Vinegar is now mainly used in the culinary arts: as a flavorful, acidic cooking ingredient, or in pickling.
>As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a wide variety of industrial and domestic uses (such as its use as a household cleaner).
>While vinegar making may be as old as alcoholic brewing, the first documented evidence of vinegar making and use was by the Ancient Babylonians around 3000 BC.
>They primarily made vinegar from dates, figs, and beer and used it for both culinary and medicinal purposes.
>Traces of it also have been found in Egyptian urns.
>In East Asia, the Chinese began professionalizing vinegar production in the Zhou Dynasty.
>In the book Zhou Li, it mentions many noble or royal households had a “vinegar maker” as a specialized position.
>Most vinegar making then was concentrated in what is now Shanxi province near the city Taiyuan which remains a famous vinegar making region today.
>Many Chinese vinegars and their uses for culinary and medicinal purposes were written down in the agricultural manual Qimin Yaoshu.

  Ciphertext: DXKGMXEWNWGPJTCNVSHOBGASBTCBHPQFAOESCNODGWTNTCKY

## Hints
 All letters must be capitalized.

## Solution
 This was a rather weird challenge. Being worth the most points, this one wasn't difficult, just required you to find the correct cipher. Deciphering the morse in the title, it decodes to `half`. A quick google search of 'half morese cipher' lead us to [Fractioned Morse cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/fractionated-morse)

 The cipher does not even rquire a key! so decrypting the cipher we get `RTCPTW0GALLONSOFH4LFMAK3WH0LEM1LK E`


## Flag
